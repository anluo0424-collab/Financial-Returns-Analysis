# 01. Returns Analysis

This notebook focuses on the calculation and analysis of stock returns
using NumPy.

It demonstrates how raw price data can be transformed into meaningful
return metrics that serve as the foundation for risk modeling and
portfolio analysis.

# 02. Portfolio Volatility Analysis

This notebook analyzes portfolio risk through volatility estimation
at both the individual asset and portfolio levels.

It applies the variance–covariance framework commonly used in
quantitative finance to aggregate risk across multiple assets.

# 03. GBM-Based Monte Carlo Stock Price Simulation

This notebook simulates stock price paths using the Geometric Brownian
Motion (GBM) model under the Black–Scholes–Merton framework.

The objective is to demonstrate how stochastic processes can be used
to model the evolution of asset prices and to visualize the distribution
of possible future price trajectories.
