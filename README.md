# Financial-Returns-Analysis
A small quantitative finance toolkit built with NumPy to analyze stock performance and portfolio risk.

# GBM Monte Carlo Simulation
This project simulates stock price paths using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model.

- 252 trading days per year  
- 10,000 simulated paths  
- Uses the exact solution of GBM  
- Demonstrates how simulated paths fluctuate around the theoretical mean

This repository includes:
- Code for generating GBM paths  
- Visualization of sample paths  
- Comparison with theoretical expected value

The goal is to provide a simple and clear implementation of GBM for learning, teaching, and financial modeling practice.
