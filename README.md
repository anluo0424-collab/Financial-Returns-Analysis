# 01. Returns Analysis

This notebook focuses on the calculation and analysis of stock returns
using NumPy.

It demonstrates how raw price data can be transformed into meaningful
return metrics that serve as the foundation for risk modeling and
portfolio analysis.

# 02. Portfolio Volatility Analysis

This notebook analyzes portfolio risk through volatility estimation
at both the individual asset and portfolio levels.

It applies the variance–covariance framework commonly used in
quantitative finance to aggregate risk across multiple assets.

# 03. GBM Monte Carlo Simulate Stock Price
This project simulates stock price paths using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model under Black–Scholes–Merton model framework.

- 252 trading days per year  
- 10,000 simulated paths  
- Uses the exact solution of GBM  
- Demonstrates how simulated paths fluctuate around the theoretical mean

This repository includes:
- Code for generating GBM paths  
- Visualization of sample paths  
- Comparison with theoretical expected value

The goal is to provide a simple and clear implementation of GBM for learning, teaching, and financial modeling practice.
